# End-to-End MLOps Pipeline for English→French Translation with Mistral-7B and QLoRA

## Overview
This project is an end-to-end MLOps pipeline for English→French translation using Mistral-7B-v0.3 fine-tuned with QLoRA (4-bit quantization + LoRA). The solution achieves high-quality translations on the WMT14 fr-en benchmark, 
enabling real-time interactive translation via a Gradio web demo. The pipeline is designed to be reproducible, scalable, and production-ready, with future plans for API deployment and Docker containerization.
